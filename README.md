# EXP 02 :Fitting Poisson  distribution
# AIM : 

To fit poisson distribution for the arrival of objects per minute from the feeder

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED :  

Python and Visual component tool

# THEORY :

The Poisson distribution is the discrete probability distribution of the number of events occurring in a given time period, given the average number of times the event occurs over that time period.

 Conditions for Poisson Distribution:

1. An event can occur any number of times during a time period.
2. Events occur independently. I
3. The rate of occurrence is constant.
4. The probability of an event occurring is proportional to the length of the time period.

# RESULTS : 

The Poisson distribution is fitted for the objects arrived from feeder per minute and the data is tested using Chi-square test.
